          Calculating MODRM Byte From simple assembly program
Prerequisites:
          A text file containing IA-32 assembly code.
Running The Program:
  Input: 
      Enter any text file name which contains IA-32 assembly code.
      eg: Enter File Name.........assembly.txt
Output: 
      A "modrm_readme.txt" Text file containing MOD R/M byte for each instruction.(empty line for increment and decrement instruction
      and for instruction containing label,label is written in file).
      To see the output open the above text file.
Running Tests:
      To test the code,run it using separate instructions for move,add,sub,mul.
      (note. This code not supports for instructions like xor,cmp,etc.)
BuiltWith:
      Python.
